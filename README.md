# Image-Filtering-Using-OpenCV
Three different image filters were implemented using OpenCV: Kuwahara filter, Gaussian filter, and Mean filter.


```
# three filters available: gaussian, kuwahara and mean
# size is the filter dimension
python main.py --image=image.jpg --filter=gaussian --size=7 --sigma=2
```
